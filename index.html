    Hello! My name is Junaed and I’m currently studying Computer Science with a goal of earning my Bachelor's degree.
    I enjoy learning new skills and challenging myself through different tech projects.
    One of my biggest interests is web development, and I’m excited to improve my HTML and CSS skills.
    Outside of academics, I have a creative side and love capturing photos.
    This course is part of my journey to become more confident in building websites from scratch.
